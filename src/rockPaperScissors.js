/* exported rockPaperScissors */

/*
 * Write a function that generates every sequence of throws a single
 * player could play over a three-round game of rock-paper-scissors.
 *
 * Your output should look something like:
 *   [["rock", "rock", "rock"],
 *    ["rock", "rock", "paper"],
 *    ["rock", "rock", "scissors"],
 *    ["rock", "paper", "rock"],
 *    ...etc...
 *   ]
 *
 * After you finish it, change your function so that it return answers for any number of rounds.
 * Example:
 *   rockPaperScissors(4); // => [['rock', 'rock', 'rock', 'rock'], etc...]
